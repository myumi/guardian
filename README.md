### To-Do
**BUGS**
* add "removeparent" to ui and redux
* add some sort of symbol for male/female saved dragons
* auto-scroll when calculate parents is clicked

**FEATURES**
* useContext() for settings
* save parents to a .json or .grdn file and be able to load them in

**SETTINGS**
* light mode / dark mode
* borders around colors (no borders removes margins too)
* text colors (on by default for mobile)
* center or left aligned
* rounding (2 - 5 places)
* turn on/off auto-scrolling
